Key components of Copilot Studio
Before you create autonomous agents, it's important that you understand Copilot Studio foundational elements to harness its capabilities. The following table includes the key components of Copilot Studio.


# Key Components of the Agent


| Component    | Key Capabilities                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Knowledge** | Allows the agent to use predefined documents, FAQs, or external data sources to provide instructions for the agent to respond.   |
| **Topics**    | Manages the conversation flows by defining intents, triggers, and responses for user queries.         |
| **Actions**   | Defines what the agent can do, such as triggering an action or workflow, calling an API, sending an email, or integrating with external systems to trigger an external workflow.  |
| **Triggers**  | Event-based starting points that initiate an automated flow, which help define specific conditions that activate specific actions. |
| **Activity**  | Tracks and logs interactions, providing visibility into user engagement with the agent.  |
| **Analytics** | Provides insights and performance metrics on agent usage, effectiveness, and user interactions.  |
| **Channels**  | Configures deployment options, which allows the agent to be accessible on various platforms like Microsoft Teams or internal and external websites. |
